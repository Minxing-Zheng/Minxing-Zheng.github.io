I’m a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Southern California (USC) Marshall School of Business. I’m mainly interested in network science including statistical inference on networks and graph neural networks. Besides, I am also broadly interested in the theory of machine learning and statistical learning. Recently, I have been focused on conformal prediction and fairness of machine learning. I am also a big fan of modeling reasoning via visualization. Check out this [interactive platform](https://bruce-zheng.shinyapps.io/glacier_segmententation/) for glacier segmentation (it takes a while to load the website, please be patient :) ). I’m advised by [Prof. Paromita Dubey](https://www.paromitadubey.com/). 

I did my undergraduate at Renmin University of China in Statistics and Applied Math (double Major), I was advised by [Prof. Yilin Wu](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/People/Faculty/6c758506e58e4e7fa9628e62390752d7.htm) and [Prof. Qijiang Song](http://math.ruc.edu.cn/ywb/Faculty/Inserviceteacher/Lecturer/449fab31b0bb43d6aa481a3d69360210.htm). And I also worked with [Prof. Yichen Qin](https://business.uc.edu/faculty-and-research/departments/obais/faculty/yichen-qin.html) at the University of Cincinnati. I did my master's at University of Wisconsin Madison in Statistics where I was advised by [Prof. Kris Sankaran](https://krisrs1128.github.io/LSLab/_includes/team) and [Prof. Keith Levin](https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/levin-keith/)
