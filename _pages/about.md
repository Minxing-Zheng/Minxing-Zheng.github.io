I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at University of Southern California (USC) Marshall School of Business. I’m mainly interested in network analysis, object data analysis and statistical sampling. I’m advised by [Prof. Paromita Dubey](https://www.paromitadubey.com/). 

I did my undergraduate at Renmin University of China in Statistics and Applied Math (double Major), I was advised by [Prof. Yilin Wu](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/People/Faculty/6c758506e58e4e7fa9628e62390752d7.htm) and [Prof. Qijiang Song](http://math.ruc.edu.cn/ywb/Faculty/Inserviceteacher/Lecturer/449fab31b0bb43d6aa481a3d69360210.htm). And I also worked with [Prof. Yichen Qin](https://business.uc.edu/faculty-and-research/departments/obais/faculty/yichen-qin.html) at the University of Cincinnati.
